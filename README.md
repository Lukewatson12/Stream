An application inspired by ERC1620 (payment stream) tokens

This extends on the idea of a payment stream and strives to implement different types of stream:

- Fixed duration streams
- Pausable streams
- Multi-recipient streams
- Stream to Stream payments

- A combination of all the above

- Non fungible token streams?
